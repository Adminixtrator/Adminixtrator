*Hard work pays off in the future, laziness pays off now.<br />
I’m looking for a job where I am politely ignored and left to my own devices. With unlimited Internet access, doughnuts, and coffee.<br />
Yeah! I quit my job working for Nike. Just couldn’t do it anymore.<br />
I love being a maze designer. I get completely lost in my work.<br />
Once, I had a job making stationery, but I quit because it wasn’t going anywhere.<br />
I wanted to be a baker, really kneaded the dough.<br />
I was training to be a sound technician, but I couldn’t handle feedback.<br />
Inspecting mirrors is a job I could really see myself doing.<br />
I became an archaeologist. Before long, my career was in ruins.<br />
I’m willing to work longer hours at work. As long as they’re lunch hours.<br />
I wanted to be a computer programmer, but I couldn’t hack it.<br />
Now, I’ve gotten into astronomy, and my whole career is looking up.<br />
Sure! I drink brake fluid. But I can stop anytime!*<br />

<br />

*Your friendly neighborhood SWE,*
