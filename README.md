*Hard work pays off in the future, laziness pays off now.<br />
I’m looking for a job where I am politely ignored and left to my own devices. With unlimited Internet access, doughnuts, and coffee.
Yeah! I quit my job working for Nike. Just couldn’t do it anymore.
But I love being a maze designer. I get completely lost in my work.
Once, I had a job making stationery, but I quit because it wasn’t going anywhere.
I wanted to be a baker, really kneaded the dough.
I was training to be a sound technician, but I couldn’t handle feedback.
Of course! Inspecting mirrors is a job I could really see myself doing.
I became an archaeologist. Before long, my career was in ruins.
Sure! I’m willing to work longer hours at work. As long as they’re lunch hours.
I wanted to be a computer programmer, but I couldn’t hack it.
Now, I’ve gotten into astronomy, and my whole career is looking up.
Sure! I drink brake fluid. But I can stop anytime!*
