```python
- Hard work pays off in the future, laziness pays off now.
- I’m looking for a job where I am politely ignored and left to my own devices. With unlimited Internet access, doughnuts, and coffee.
*Yeah! I quit my job working for Nike. Just couldn’t do it anymore.* <br />
*But I love being a maze designer. I get completely lost in my work.* <br />
*Once, I had a job making stationery, but I quit because it wasn’t going anywhere.* <br />
*I wanted to be a baker, really kneaded the dough.* <br />
*I was training to be a sound technician, but I couldn’t handle feedback.* <br />
*Of course! Inspecting mirrors is a job I could really see myself doing.* <br />
*I became an archaeologist. Before long, my career was in ruins.* <br />
*Sure! I’m willing to work longer hours at work. As long as they’re lunch hours.* <br />
*I wanted to be a computer programmer, but I couldn’t hack it.* <br />
*Now, I’ve gotten into astronomy, and my whole career is looking up.* <br />
*Sure! I drink brake fluid. But I can stop anytime!* <br />
<br />
<br />
*Your friendly neighborhood SWE,* <br />
